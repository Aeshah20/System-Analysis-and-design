# Problem definition
The system we work on will improve English beginners' educational experience by adding and enhancing features, services, and exercises that will enable them to master the English language. 
The new system will allow beginners to interact with English teachers for 15.96 $ for a half year as a premium and trainers for free by chatting. 
Also, there will be a dictionary and stories that will enhance four readability skills: elementary reading, inspectional reading, analytical reading, and syntopical reading. Additionally, we will add a simple explanation of courses as videos; afterward, there will be exercises supervised and written by English teachers.
Thereupon our system will solve problems that happened in the previous system, such as:
•	The exercises do not help beginners come up with their sentences by themselves or have open conversations 
because Duolingo is a  gamified app. Most of the time, the activities give them safe options such as multiple choice, rearranging sentences, and repeating specific sentences. 

•	The exercises need to be supervised by English teachers to enrich the beginners, for example, by adding some irregular grammar rules.

•	The system needs maintenance in audio recording exercises.

•	If beginners need more clarification about the solution, there is no teacher to help them.

•	The user cannot move to a particular topic till he performs the previous tasks.

•	There are no stories and no dictionary to attach hard words for memorizing.


 # Objectives
•	We aim to give users a great experience by applying our new system to old Duolingo system problems.

•	The new system will provide meaningful, logical, and grammatically correct exercises supervised by English teachers.

•	Our new system will enable the beginner to chat with teachers for premium and with other beginners for free.

•	Also, we will add a dictionary that authorizes beginners the ability to register difficult words, and the system will link the word to a reliable website to enrich their knowledge.

•	There will be a cards section that enables beginners who have learning disabilities to see and hear the sound of letters and numbers repeatedly.
